## My Biography
***Who am I***

My name is Yucan Lei. Just like everyone else, I was born in China and grew up in Zambia. I came to MACSS because even though I was an econ major during undergrad, I never had a real chance to actually learn much of any computation, only the most basic. Thus, I would like to enroll into a program that is more helpful with not only economics but computer science at the same time, which made this program the most ideal. 

*The Countries that I want to visit*
1. Britain
2. Italy
3. Korea
4. Peru
5. Japan

Now that I think about it, I do not have any "cool" photos of myself which is downright embarassing.

I do not know what kind of link I should attach here, let me share a little gem of mine I found on YouTube
it is a music video, it will start out very boring, but be sure to listen to it till the end. It should be 
rewarding.

I honestly had never learned Github before enrolling into the program, I guess that is a good sign showing 
we are seriously trying to learn quite a lot of things here. I have tried to use markdown with RStudio previously
to submit my homework, but that is as far as it gets. I had never really done anything that is "sophisiticated" with 
Markdown. It was not until this assignment that I found out we can add links on Markdown, but I guess I should have 
seen that one coming. 


Edit this README file to include a brief biography of yourself. Your README should include the following elements:
* Headers (one or more)
* Emphasis (italics or/and bold)
* Lists
* Images: add a picture (of yourself or something else) to your repo and embed it in your README
* Links
* A summary and reflection of the Git/GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and of your experience with Markdown (e.g., provide a summary of the workflow you adopted, and add some comments about something new you learned, something that surprised you, etc.)
